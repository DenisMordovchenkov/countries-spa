# Greetings!
## The project is implemented using the API provided by the site https://restcountries.com.

<p>I borrowed the idea from the website https://frontendmentor.io.</p>
<p>This is a SPA written in React without a state manager. I managed with hooks.</p>

<p>I also used the following libraries:</p>
<li>Styled-components acts as a style library.</li>
<li>axios to get data from the API</li>
<li>react-icons to display icons</li>
<li>react-select to implement a custom selector list</li>
<li>react-router-dom for routing.</li>

<p>In the demo, Hash Router is used instead of Browser Router due to the peculiarities of the githubpages page output.</p>

<p>What happened in the end?</p>  

__All countries of the world are displayed (available in the API ;-)).__  


__There is a filter by region, and a search by country name is also available.__  


__When you click on a certain country, a page opens with a description of the main characteristics and a list of neighboring countries that you can go to by clicking on the country__
